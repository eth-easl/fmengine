# ⚡️ FMEngine

FMEngine is our opinionated take on foundation model training framework. The first version of FMEngine is built on top of `PyTorch` and `DeepSpeed` and is designed to be a drop-in replacement for `DeepSpeed` with a few additional features. In the `v2` version we forked from HuggingFace's `nanotron` and added some features to make it easier to use.

# Credits

We would like to thank everyone working on LLMs, especially those sharing their work openly from which we took great inspiration:

- HuggingFace for `nanotron`,
- Nvidia for `Megatron-LM/apex`, 
- Microsoft for `DeepSpeed`,
- HazyResearch for `flash-attn`
